title: Customizing Github Profile README
---

Here is a list of resources that I found helpful to create an awesome Github profile README.

### Badges for Skills and Languages:

- [Markdown Badges](https://github.com/Ileriayo/markdown-badges)

### Github Stats

- [Github README Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

  It supports "Github Stats Card", "Github Extra Pins", "Github Gist Pins", "Top Language Card", and "WakaTime Stats Card".

### Track Coding Hours:

- [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/)
- [waka readme](https://github.com/athul/waka-readme)

  Detailed setup instructions for your profile.

- [Show off your coding stats on your GitHub Profile using WakaTime](https://medium.com/@JakenH/show-off-your-coding-stats-on-your-github-profile-using-wakatime-ce3ceb1063b5)

After you set it up in your profile, it may take some time to display in your README.

### Update Latest Blogs with Github Actions and RSS feed

- [Blog post workflow](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow)
- [How to generate an RSS feed for your blog with JavaScript and Netlify functions](https://www.contentful.com/blog/generate-blog-rss-feed-with-javascript-and-netlify/)
- [Creating an RSS Feed with a Netlify Serverless Function + Contentful](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/creating-an-rss-feed-with-a-netlify-serverless-function-contentful-21b26049f933)
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
- [contentful.js - Contentful JavaScript Delivery SDK](https://contentful.github.io/contentful.js/contentful/8.1.7/index.html)

  My current "latest blog posts" are updated manually as I haven't set up my RSS feed for my blogs. My website doesn't have a server and the most common way to do it as introduced in [How to create an RSS Feed](https://rss.com/blog/how-to-create-an-rss-feed/) is not applicable in my case. Luckily, I found the way of achieving it by using Contentful and Netlify. I will add "setting up RSS Feed" as one of the new features I want to make for my website.

### Utilize HTML Tags details and summary

- [details: The Details disclosure element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)
- [summary: The Disclosure Summary element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary)

### Customizing SVGs

- [Adding custom HTML and CSS to GitHub README](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/adding-custom-html-and-css-to-github-readme/)

  This is the first time that I learned that SVGs can get customized by HTML and CSS. I didn't utilize this in my current README, but I probably will try it in the future.

### Social Icons

- [Special icons for social accounts on GitHub](https://dev.to/yoshi389111/special-icons-for-social-accounts-on-github-404k)

### Profile generators

- [Github profile readme generator](https://github.com/rahuldkjain/github-profile-readme-generator)
- [Profile readme generator](https://github.com/maurodesouza/profile-readme-generator)
